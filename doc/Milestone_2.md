# Milestone 2: Application Development


## Mission

A simple-to-use application that presents customized segmentations using mental health data.

Details:
- to help human resource researchers to understand general attitudes towards mental health in the workplace from both employees and self-employers across the world. 

- The visualization includes distributions of factors that may contribute to the likelihood of individuals seeking help and receiving treatments. 

- With a built-in sidebar, users can explore different sub-groups within people who have had mental health treatment and those who have not by filtering variables of interest.


## Pre-design stage

Our application focuses on showing difference in general attitude from different segmentations towards the corporate mental health issues.

We envisioned our application to break down the data by the overarching segmentation - 


## User Interface - Design Choices

Our application interface has three components:

 - **Left** : Control bar for filtering the data
     - Rationale: This allows users to customize the graphic presentation on the right hand side. Users can filter by country, gender and age, which are the three main 
 - **Right**: Visualization by subjects
     - Rationale: Bar graph is our main choice for data visualization as it is the most intuitive graph for users. The bar graph varies depending on the number of observations within the segmentation produced by users'preference from the left control bar.
     - Colour
 - **Tabs**: 



## Segmentations - Data wrangling 

The overarching segmentation for this app is 

received treatment or not



Main level:

- Countries
- Gender
- Age

Second level:

- Difference in corporate support 



A clean version of data is required in order to produce a meaningful report. In the raw dataset, we
