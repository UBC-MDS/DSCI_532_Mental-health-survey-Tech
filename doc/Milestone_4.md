# Milestone 4 - Last Improvement


### Changes made

In this final week, given the time limit we have deployed the following changes to our application:

- "About" tab

We added the "About" tab to the application to show the statistics of the data. In this tab, we included bar graphs to show the total number of observations per country and per gender used in the application. This is inspired by the fact that we want to be transparent about the information we present in our application/app. Also, we would like users of our app to ponder whether the number of observations per variable is statistically sufficient for them to make a sound claim.

### Usability - Did the application actually deliver what we promised in our objectives?
The quality and accuracy of the code associated with your changes.
The effectiveness of the change with respect to your app's objective.



### Reflection

If we were to make the app again from scratch, we would opt for using plotly instead of ggplot (for more interactive features). We would also use template instead for better user interface design.

The greatest challenges we had while developing this application is the pairwise comparison on the interview questions. The questions were designed to compare two different scenarios that we thought the comparison would be interesting to show. (i.e.how comfortable you are to discuss mental issues with your coworker versus your manager?) 

While we could achieve the comparison by doing a major data wrangling and then producing the responsive graphs based on filters in Shiny App, we are under a strict time limitation for us to do that.

Exercise 2: Implementation
rubric={quality:10, accuracy:10, reasoning:40}

Implement the changes that you've decided to make. We'll be grading:

The quality and accuracy of the code associated with your changes.
The effectiveness of the change with respect to your app's objective.
