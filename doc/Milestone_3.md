# Milestone 3


## Feedback from peer review

During the peer review session, our team received a lot of useful feedback. They are generalized in the following points:

-  The application tabs are most liked by our peer as it helps them to understand the data characteristics and the problems the applictaion is trying to adddress.

- Our team shows a good understanding of the data and statistics. Countries are filtered to only countries with sufficient data points (observations more than 10).

- Graphs are not intuitive for readers to have a quick grasp of the situation or to comprehend the explorative data analysis. We will address this in our improved application coming up.

- The application needs to utilize the empty space with more descriptions with regards to the data, how-to-use,colour coding and labelling.

- Visualization needs to improve on:
    - Font size to be bigger
    - Display size to be more compact
    - Decription on variables to be more detailed


### Improvement on Application

With our objectives of the application unchanged, we improved our application based on all the feedback we have recevied within a limited timeframe.

** Graphic Presentation **

The biggest improvement we are proud is the visualization. With facceting, we have fitted four variables within the display without users having to scroll up and down as before. We have also added more details under each graph to explain what the variables they are. Here is the before-and-after comparison:

### Reflection from peer review


We have learned several good tricks to improve our application from adopting the strength of other applications when applicable. 

The most valuable part of the review process is "fly-on-the-walL". It is useful for us as it simulates how real-life users views our application and whethere our applictaion is intuitive for them without our verbal explanation. In fact, we received more realistic feedback during this process.


### Future work

There are more improvement we would like to work on if we are given more time to learn more about shiny app. For example, we would like to group the interview questions by pair as the questions are constructed to compare two scenarios (i.e.how comfortable you are to discuss mental issues with your coworker versus your manager?)

But due to the limitation in our time, we cannot summerize the questions in pairwise comparison.
